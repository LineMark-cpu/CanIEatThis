"# CanIEatThis" 

The application will be used for assessing food items in relation to allergies or unwanted ingredients and nutrients that have been registered in the application by the user.
Moreover, the user can register target objectives for daily intake of ingredients and nutrients.

The application will keep track of daily food intake in terms of nutrients and ingredients, and relate this data to the list of unwanted as well as target ingredients and/or nutrients to give the user an indication of how well his/her daily food intake sticks to the objective. 

The motivation behind the app is to support nutritional goals and provide an easy assessment of processed food.
